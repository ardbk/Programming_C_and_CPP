1. Error: "unknown type name 'string'; did you mean 'std::string'?"
Or "use of undeclared identifier 'cout'; did you mean 'std::cout'?"

Since we use undeclared identifier count, string, endl, cin, the project will not compile.

Using "std::cout", "std::cin", "std::endl", "std::string" would solve the error.

2. Error: "use of undeclared identifier 'name'"

Since we don't write the class to which the method belongs to, for the compiler these identifiers are unknown. In this case, the class is Critter. 

Declaring the methods independent from the class would solve the error.
